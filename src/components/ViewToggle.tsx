// src/components/ViewToggle.tsx
// STRATFIT — View Toggle (Legacy - kept for compatibility)
// This component was used for operator/investor view toggle but is now deprecated
// The app uses UnifiedHeader for view mode switching

import React from "react";

// Legacy component - no longer actively used
// Kept to prevent import errors in case it's referenced somewhere
export default function ViewToggle() {
  return null; // Component disabled - view toggling handled by UnifiedHeader
}
