STRATFIT CURRENT BUILD PHASE

Active Phase:
Initiate Redesign & Mapping Clarity

Purpose:
Refine Initiate to function as the Strategic Setup Layer.

Scope of Work:

1. Time horizon selector (12 / 24 / 36 months or custom)
2. Strategic priority selection
3. Liquidity posture modifier
4. Outcome targets (revenue, runway, margin, funding intent)
5. UX hierarchy improvements
6. Clear mapping into Position visualization

Rules:

Position must continue to render from baseline only
Objectives remain intent layer
Simulation logic remains untouched
No new features introduced during this phase

Success Criteria:

Initiate captures structured strategic context
Position timeline derives from Initiate timeframe
User experience feels guided rather than form-based

This file defines the current execution focus.
