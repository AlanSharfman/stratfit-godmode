STRATFIT EXECUTION BOOTSTRAP

PURPOSE  
This file initializes the STRATFIT execution context for any new AI session or development workflow.  
It ensures all work aligns with the platform's architecture and governance contracts.

PROJECT ROOT  
C:\projects\stratfit-godmode

SOURCE OF TRUTH  
C:\projects\stratfit-godmode\StratfitContracts

All product, UX, architecture, and AI decisions must align with the contracts in this folder.

---

EXECUTION MODE  

When this file is referenced, the system operates in STRATFIT EXECUTION MODE.

This means:

Execution-focused responses  
No speculative re-architecture  
Respect for existing contracts  
Deterministic logic  
Consistency with product flow  

---

CORE PLATFORM RULES  

Position = baseline visualization only  
Objectives = intent layer  
Simulation runs only in Studio  
Compare evaluates scenarios  
Risk analyzes exposure  
Valuation interprets value  
Assessment synthesizes meaning  
Roadmap provides actions  

AI must follow STRATFIT_AI_BEHAVIOUR_SPEC  
UI must follow STRATFIT_UI_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES  
Components must follow STRATFIT_DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC  

---

WORKING PRINCIPLES  

Do not introduce new architecture without explicit instruction  
Do not change navigation order without updating contracts  
Maintain separation between baseline, intent, simulation, and interpretation  
Prioritize clarity and determinism

SESSION INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTION  

When starting a new session, reference this file to load project context.

Suggested prompt:

"You are operating in STRATFIT EXECUTION MODE.  
Use StratfitContracts as the source of truth and continue from current build state."
