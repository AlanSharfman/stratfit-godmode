STRATFIT UI DESIGN PRINCIPLES v1

PURPOSE  
Define the visual and interaction principles that guide all UI decisions across the STRATFIT platform.  
This ensures consistency, clarity, and a premium product feel.

---

CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY  

STRATFIT must feel:

Clear  
Intentional  
Calm  
Professional  
Insight-focused  

The interface should never feel busy, playful, or overly decorative.

---

VISUAL HIERARCHY  

1. Primary information must always dominate the screen  
2. Secondary information must be visually quieter  
3. Decorative elements must never compete with data  

Use contrast, spacing, and typography to guide attention.

---

LAYOUT PRINCIPLES  

Use grid-based layouts  
Maintain consistent spacing scale  
Avoid cramped elements  
Provide breathing room around key content  

Content should align cleanly to visual anchors.

---

SPACING SYSTEM  

Use consistent spacing increments (e.g. 4px / 8px scale)  
Large sections must have clear vertical separation  
Avoid uneven padding  

Consistency in spacing is more important than density.

---

TYPOGRAPHY PRINCIPLES  

Use a single primary font family  
Limit font weights to a small set (e.g. regular, medium, bold)  
Headings must be clearly distinguishable from body text  
Avoid excessive font size variation  

Text should be easy to scan and read at a glance.

---

COLOR PRINCIPLES  

Use a restrained palette  
Primary color used sparingly for emphasis  
Neutral tones dominate layout  
Avoid high-saturation backgrounds  

Color should communicate meaning, not decoration.

---

INTERACTION FEEDBACK  

All user actions must produce feedback:

Hover states  
Active states  
Loading states  
Success confirmations  

No silent interactions.

---

MOTION PRINCIPLES  

Motion should be subtle and purposeful  
Use animation to communicate state changes  
Avoid excessive or distracting motion  

Animations must enhance clarity, not entertainment.

---

COMPONENT CONSISTENCY  

Buttons, cards, panels, and inputs must follow consistent styling  
Avoid introducing new styles without updating the design system  

Every repeated element must look and behave the same.

---

DATA VISUALIZATION  

Data must be legible and interpretable at a glance  
Avoid unnecessary visual noise  
Use consistent visual language for charts and indicators  

Clarity always outweighs visual novelty.

---

SIMULATION VISUALIZATION  

Terrain, paths, and markers must feel grounded and stable  
Avoid visual effects that reduce interpretability  
Focus on conveying meaning rather than spectacle  

The visualization must feel analytical, not game-like.

---

UX PRIORITY  

Users should always understand:

Where they are  
What they are seeing  
What action they can take  

Clarity is the highest design priority.

---

OUT OF SCOPE  

Avoid:

Decorative UI trends  
Overly complex animations  
Multiple visual styles  
Experimental layouts without purpose  

---

SUCCESS CRITERIA  

A new user should perceive STRATFIT as:

Professional  
Trustworthy  
Easy to understand  
Focused on insight
